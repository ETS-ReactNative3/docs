The organization audit log grants [Organization Administrators](/concepts/access-control#organization-administrator) access to review **actions** performed by individual members of the organization. In addition, each audit log includes **events** detailing who performed the **action** and when it happened.

On the [Scaler plan](https://docs.chatty-cloud.com/concepts/billing#chatty-cloud-plans), audit log events are retained for 15 days in your ChattyCloud account. On the free Developer plan, audit logs are retained for 5 days.
